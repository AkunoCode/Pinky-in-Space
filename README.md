This is my first attempt in learning how to create a game using PyGame. Since this is just my first attempt, there might be errors, bugs, or things that needs to be improved or changed in this game, I hope you could point those out by sending me a message, either through github or my email [echevariajohnleo@gmail.com](mailto:echevariajohnleo@gmail.com).<br>
**Thank you~!**
